<p>To Sonya Maizell for writing the introductory story</p>
<p>The NERO Game System is intended to allow players and staff hours of live-action fun without any amount of play stoppage. It is the responsibility of the players and staff to remember this when reading and interpreting the rules. We have done our best to clear up vagaries and make there rules sound, and we will continue to do so in the future. still, players and staff should avoid constantly trying to find loopholes or language that allows them to do things that are against the spirit of the rules. the NERO international office will determine the spirit of the rules in all cases where interpenetration is disputed.</p>
