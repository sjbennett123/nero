EMT Guidelines
Every NERO Event will need to have at least a few people that will respond when there is a medical emergency. At some games they will simply be the Marshals at other games they will be people with actual medical training. When dealing with medical issues be confident make sure that the person feels that they are being taken care of. This will help them relax and will let you work with them better.
When performing first aid if you are concerned about the safety of a person ask the player "Do you want me to call the paramedics (an ambulance)". This elevates the situation and makes it more real and serious. If they are truly hurt then the paramedics are far better suited to take care of this than the on site EMT. If they refuse medical service it removes liability from the game.
The most common issues that you will face are as follows.
* Heat Stroke / Dehydration – Give the player cold water or Gatorade a candy bar (preferably a Snickers),. then make them sit for 20 minutes.
* Twisted Ankle - Ice it to bring down the swelling. Depending on the severity of the sprain let them make the call to bandage it or not. Once an ankle is sprained, the muscle that supported it is injured and at its weakest so is susceptible to sprain the ankle again.
* Broken limb - Don't move them. Whatever is hurt whichever limb is hurt don't let it move. Stabilize it. 
* Head/Neck Injury - Do NOT move them. Call an Ambulance 
Before the Event make sure that you have.
1.) Medical Insurance Information for all players
This is important if you need to go to the hospital and it's the last thing you want to deal with in that situation. Keep this information in a place that you can get to it.
2.) Any Medication that is taken by players. 
At opening ceremonies anybody that is taking medication they need to tell the EMT staff. Keep this written down in their file and remember that people are generally not used to all this running around. They may forget to take medications on time. Additionally they may get tired or dehydrated which will interact with their medications.
3.) Any allergies that The Player Have.
Keep a list of any allergies that the players have so that you know what to be concerned about if they start to react.
4.) Closest Hospital - Know where the closest hospital is and how to get there. Have an address and driving directions from campsite. Also have directions for the ambulance to get to the campsite.
* St Josephs Hospital -  1 Amalia Dr Buckhannon, WV 26201 (304) 473-2000
* Davis Memorial Hospital - 812 Gorman Avenue Elkins WV,26241 (304) 636-3300
-If they want you to call the paramedics send someone to the camp entrance to meet that paramedics because they will get lost.
-If they refuse paramedics but want to go to the hospital. They have refused EMT services and their friends can pick them up and take them to the car. 
5.) Does 911 Work in this area if not what is the emergency Medical Number
* 911 Works in Elkins
Important Equipment to have on site
*Ace Bandages - super important
*Tylenol/Advil - For headaches/swelling 
*Candy Bars - For dehydration/ heat stroke helps make people feel better. Snickers bars are the best. 
*Neck Brace - optional helps to make people more comfortable. Generally people whose neck is hurt will be fine but they are scared and need to be reassured.
