Orange headband- Some players at the event cannot enter combat and are playing under ‘Page’ Status. A Page should never be struck with a weapon or claw. In order to attack a page, you can point your weapon or packet at the Page and state “I kill you, page!”, or “I down you” (bleeding out) or any number of other actions. If there is someone within 5 feet of the Page, they can choose to defend the page and block your attack. To do so, they must state “I defend you” and role-play accordingly. A person cannot defend a page if they do not have a weapon, shield, or other ability to do so. All pages must wear an Orange headband to signify they are under Page status.
