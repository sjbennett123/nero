<p>Duration: Indefinate</p>
<p>The victim of this poison will be enslaved to the person administering the poison and will obey absolutely any and all commands given by the person to whom they are enslaved, and will even commit</p>
<p>suicide. Otherwise, it is has the same effects as a Charm spell. Enslavement can only be cured by a specific antidote. This effect is also removed if the character resurrects. This effect is stronger than Calm, Calm Animal, Charm, Charm Animal, Shun, shun animal, Control Undead, or Fear. See Table 5-6 on page 64. Please note that additional Enslavement effects will override another </p>
<p>Enslavement effect, see "Charm Effects" on page 47.</p>
<p>Enslavement is a powerful ability which particularly has the potential to ruin the fun of any player. As such the use of this effect can never be used by a PC on a PC.</p>
<p>No other effect (either LCO or otherwise) may duplicate the ability of Enslavement.</p>
<p>In addition, the following rules apply to Enslavement: </p>
<p>You cannot administer Enslavement to yourself.</p>
<p>You cannot be enslaved to "Act normally".However a person under the effects of enslavement does not act like a robot or strangely, they are just compelled to follow the wishes of the enslaver.</p>
<p>The duration of Enslavement is permanent, and it can only be cured by the specific antidote or the resurrection of the target.</p>
