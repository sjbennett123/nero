NPC Speech
Remember we are here to have fun first and foremost. Always try to be respectful to other players and the game. If we keep this in mind we will get rid of most of the issues that could crop up. 
If you don't know a rule ask  - Please if you don't know what a rule is ask a Running Staff member or a marshal. There will also be rulebooks around the NPC shack feel free to reference them. Don't just wing it through an encounter it will create confusion and make the game worse.
Always have a card - When you go out as a monster make sure that you have a card for the monster. There are no exceptions to this. 
Play well but not to win. - When NPC'ing we are not playing to win but we are not playing to loose either. We are playing to 'See what happens'. The cards are statted and chosen by the Running Staff. Don't be worried if the players win but don't be concerned if they lose either.
If you don't know what to do ask - Don't wait for the running staff to tell you to do something. If you are waiting ask one of the Running Staff what you can do and they will tell you.
Make sure that you look good - When you play a role make sure that you look as good as you can manage. The players put a lot of work into their costumes we need to respect that.
Setting and Factions - We talk more in detail about the setting and factions for the weekend. 
Timeline - We discuss the general plan for the event which modules happen when.
